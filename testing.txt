A Proud History
FDH was established in 1994 by two engineering professors and a graduate student from North Carolina State University. The first research question the company investigated was posed by the North Carolina Department of Transportation: How do you determine the length and integrity of thousands of aging in-situ bridge piles for which no (or limited) as-built information exists? FDH developed a proprietary nondestructive test method, using dispersive wave propagation, to address this challenge. Three patents later, FDH continues to develop and deploy innovative technologies to accurately assess the health of critical infrastructure without disturbing operations.

Safety Leadership
FDH is a member of the 100% Tie-Off 24/7 Awareness Campaign, an industry-wide safety initiative to raise awareness of the 100% tie-off fall protection requirement. FDH is committed to driving home the message that there should be a zero-tolerance policy regarding this law. Many of the accidents that compromise safety in the tower industry involve situations in which the tower technician was not properly tied-off to the structure.
